#
# You're probably looking here thinking you need to create some new copy
# of linux-libc-headers since you have your own custom kernel. To put 
# this simply, you DO NOT.
#
# Why? These headers are used to build the libc. If you customise the 
# headers you are customising the libc and the libc becomes machine
# specific. Most people do not add custom libc extensions to the kernel
# and have a machine specific libc.
#
# But you have some kernel headers you need for some driver? That is fine
# but get them from STAGING_KERNEL_DIR where the kernel installs itself.
# This will make the package using them machine specific but this is much
# better than having a machine specific C library. This does mean your
# recipe needs a
#    do_configure[depends] += "virtual/kernel:do_shared_workdir"
# but again, that is fine and makes total sense.
#
# There can also be a case where your kernel extremely old and you want
# an older libc ABI for that old kernel. The headers installed by this
# recipe should still be a standard mainline kernel, not your own custom 
# one.
